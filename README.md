## 🧭 Roadmap
## 🚧 November 2025 – January 2026: Device Fundamentals
## I. Build 3D Visualizations of Basic Semiconductor Devices
## 1-1. NMOS Transistor

  ## 1-1-1 — 3D Device Model
  A clean, structured representation showing drain, source, channel, and the full gate stack.
  
  ## 1-1-2 — Electrical Interaction Animations
  Visualize device physics as users interactively change V<sub>G</sub>, V<sub>D</sub>, and V<sub>S</sub> (e.g., channel formation, current flow).

## 1-2. PMOS Transistor

Same structure as the NMOS, including 3D modeling and voltage-dependent animations.

## 1-3. PN Junction Diode

3D schematic representation showing P/N regions, depletion layer, and contacts.

Interactive visualization of forward bias, reverse bias, and depletion width changes.

## 🧱 2026 (Ongoing): Complex Semiconductor Systems
## II. Build Interactive 3D Models of Chips

## 2-1. CPU

## 2-1-1 — High-Level 3D Chip Overview
Representation of logic blocks, caches, ALUs, and other major components.

## 2-1-2 — Interconnect Visualization
Layers, metallization, vias, BEOL structure.

## 2-1-3 — CPU Execution Animation
Demonstrate a processor performing tasks (e.g., arithmetic operations, saving an image).

## 2-2. NAND Flash & Memory Chips

(Will follow the same approach as CPU: physical representation → interconnects → functional animation.)

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions of all kinds — visuals, physics corrections, UX improvements, documentation, or code.

## Contribution Guidelines

Accuracy first.
Ensure the animations and visualizations are consistent with known semiconductor physics.

Clarity matters.
Visuals should help beginners understand concepts without oversimplifying them.

Keep things accessible.
Use clear naming, intuitive UI, and helpful tooltips where needed.

Make it your own.
Bring your ideas, creativity, and expertise. All improvements are welcome.
