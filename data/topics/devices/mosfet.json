It acts as an electronic switch that can be turned on or off by applying voltage to its gate terminal.\n\n**Key Components:**\n- **Gate**: Control terminal\n- **Source**: Electron entry point\n- **Drain**: Electron exit point\n- **Substrate**: Silicon base (p-type for NMOS)\n\nMOSFETs are the basis for digital logic, memory, and almost all modern electronics.",
